// This page (InteractiveReportPage.tsx) was previously created for an interactive coffee report.
// Its functionality was subsequently merged into the main ProductsPage.tsx to consolidate product information.
//
// The recent user prompt provided a specification for an interactive "Farm to Port Coffee Journey Timeline"
// under this filename. That timeline feature has been implemented as a new component
// (components/products/CoffeeJourneyTimeline.tsx) and integrated directly into the ProductsPage.tsx,
// replacing a previous static display of coffee process details.
//
// Therefore, this InteractiveReportPage.tsx file is not currently used or routed in the application.
